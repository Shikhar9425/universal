		System.out.print("Architecture-neutral\nJava is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.\nIn C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.\n\tPortable \nJava is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.\nHigh-performance\nJava is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++). Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages, e.g., C, C++, etc.");
